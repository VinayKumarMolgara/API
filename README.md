## üìú Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the frontend app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the frontend app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run eject`

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

### `node server.js`

Runs the backend server. The server will typically run on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Running the Frontend

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd api-hub/client
    ```

2. Start the React development server:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

    This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Running the Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```sh
    cd api-hub/backend
    ```

2. Install backend dependencies (if you haven't already):

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the Express server:

    ```sh
    node server.js
    ```

    This will start the backend server, typically running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### Running Both Frontend and Backend Concurrently

To run both frontend and backend servers concurrently, you can use a tool like `concurrently`. First, install `concurrently`:

```sh
npm install concurrently --save-dev
```

Then, add a new script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "concurrently \"npm run start:client\" \"npm run start:server\"",
  "start:client": "cd client && npm start",
  "start:server": "cd backend && node server.js"
}
```

Now, you can start both servers with a single command:

```sh
npm start
```

## üóÑÔ∏è MongoDB Atlas Configuration

To configure MongoDB Atlas for your backend, follow these steps:


1. Add the following code to `db.js`, replacing `<your-mongo-db-uri>` with your actual MongoDB Atlas URI:

    ```js
     mongoose.connect('<your-mongo-db-uri>')

    
    ```

## üåê Connecting to MongoDB using Compass

To connect to your MongoDB Atlas cluster using MongoDB Compass, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Install MongoDB Compass**: If you haven't already, download and install MongoDB Compass from the [official website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass).

2. **Obtain your MongoDB Atlas Connection String**:
    - Go to your MongoDB Atlas dashboard.
    - Navigate to your cluster and click on the "Connect" button.
    - Select "Connect with MongoDB Compass."
    - Copy the provided connection string. It should look something like this:

    ```sh
    mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    ```

3. **Open MongoDB Compass**:
    - Launch MongoDB Compass on your computer.

4. **Connect to your Cluster**:
    - In the MongoDB Compass welcome screen, paste your connection string into the "Paste your connection string (SRV or Standard)" field.
    - Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<dbname>` with your actual MongoDB Atlas credentials and database name.
    - Click on "Connect."

5. **Explore your Database**:
    - Once connected, you can explore your collections, documents, run queries, and perform various operations directly from MongoDB Compass.
